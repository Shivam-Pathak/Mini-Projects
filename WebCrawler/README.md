#WebCraler 
Extracting all links of a web page is a common task now among web scrapers, it is useful to build advanced scrapers that crawl every page of a certain website to extract data, it can also be used for SEO diagnostics process or even information gathering phase for penetration testers. Build using only requests and BeautifulSoup libraries. 

Any ideas for some functionality to add to this crawler? please let me know:)
